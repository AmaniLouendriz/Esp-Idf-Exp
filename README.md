# Summary

In a separate group project, my teammates and I built an embedded chlorine distributor using Arduino microcontroller and Arduino coding style. This project covers the attempt to switch the codebase from Arduino framework to an ESP-IDF one on an ESP32 chip; covering more functionalities like Wifi connection and usage of ESP-IDF API powers, so far the SNTP and WIFI api methods were really interesting.

The project is built using ESP-IDF vs code extension. The chip I use is an esp32 WROOM 32U.
